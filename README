Find color schemes with optimally distinct colors using Delta E (CIE2000).

Procedure to find color schemes:

  1. Generate all combinations (color schemes) of the chosen hues.
  2. Discard all color schemes with colors that are too close.
  3. For each color scheme adjust colors to meet the chosen minimum Delta E
     towards the background.
  4. For each color scheme calculate Delta E for all color combinations.
     Discard color schemes with Delta E values that are too low.
  5. Output optimal color schemes.

Parameters intended to be adjusted to your liking are documented in the source.
